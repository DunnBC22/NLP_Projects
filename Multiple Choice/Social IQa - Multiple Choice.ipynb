    "- It looks like 67.5 percent is the State of the Art value for BERT (the 'Large' BERT checkpoint, not the base checkpoint) on Multiple Choice with the SWAG dataset. Having done some smaller initial test runs and trying this project with distilBERT originally, I am sure that with more training (4 or 5 epochs instead of 3), I could achieve metrics more in line with the State of the Art value. \n",
